# SQL Project - Practice Problems
Hello there, I wanted to brush up on my SQL concepts. So using MySQL I solved intermediate and difficult SQL homework problems posted by chandoo on their website. I had fun answering those questions because they required to use many SQL concepts, which helped me to quickly brush up on SQL concepts.

## Some of the important SQL topics which I used during solving problems are: 
**Select statements:** The foundation of all SQL queries that helps to retrieve the data.

**Where clause:** Helps to filter data based on conditions. Operators used in where clause are =, >, >=, <, <=, <>, Between, Like, IN.

**Group by:** Group by statement helps to group rows that have the same values. It is mostly used with aggregate functions. To filter result set after grouping the data having clause is used.
**Aggregate functions** are Count, Sum, Min, Max, Avg.

**Order by:** It helps to sort the result set. By default it is sorted in ascending order. To sort it in descending order use desc keyword.

**Joins:** It is used to combine rows from multiple tables using common column between them. Types of joins are left join, right join, inner join, full outer join, self join, natural join, cross join.

**Case statements:** It helps to evaluate conditions and returns a value if the first condition is met otherwise next conditions are checked if none of the conditions are true then else part gets executed. 
 
Some of the **date functions** are also used based upon the question they are: month(), monthname(), year(), weekday().
